## Abstract :
Now a days, people are having very busy schedules due to changes in their lifestyle and work commitments. People are not concentrating in their food habits, hence it leads to obesity. Obesity is becoming a common problem in todayâ€™s modern life. So that we ne

## Introduction :
The fast-food consumption rate is alarmingly high and this consequently has led to the intake of unhealthy food. This leads to various health issues such as obesity, diabetes, an increase in blood pressure etc.hence can reduce weight or they can help them to keep them fit and healthy. This project focuses on the calories burned in accordance with the duration provided and heart rate during the exercise period. It introduces the topic of XGBM regression and its predicting capability with the effectiveness from the data provided. This research helps in providing the benefits of a machine learning algorithm over predicting the calories burned.
## Conclusion :
 By this project I build the machine Learning model- 'Calories Burn Prediction' that helps People to become sensible about their fitness and calories burn by doing exercise

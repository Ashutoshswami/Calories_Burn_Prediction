# Calories_Burn_Prediction
Calories burnt prediction using Machine Learning with Python. For this prediction, I have used XGBoost Regressor model.

#Introduction :

In this fast and busy schedule life, people are not giving importance to the quality of food they are eating. They tend to neglect their eating patterns and habits. The fast-food consumption rate is alarmingly high and this consequently has led to the intake of unhealthy food. This leads to various health issues such as obesity, diabetes, an increase in blood pressure etc.hence can reduce weight or they can help them to keep them fit and healthy. This project focuses on the calories burned in accordance with the duration provided and heart rate during the exercise period. It introduces the topic of XGBM regression and its predicting capability with the effectiveness from the data provided. This research helps in providing the benefits of a machine learning algorithm over predicting the calories burned.
